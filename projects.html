        <p class="problem-">
          Problem: Lifeblood was experiencing high numbers of cancelations and
          needed a revamp on their booking experience.
        </p>
        <p class="process">
          Process: Performed research and analysis to find the real causes why
          donors were canceling appointments and found the best improvements on
          their digital experience.
        </p>
        <p class="solution">
          Solution: The goal of these improvements was to reduce the cognitive
          load of the user, increase their engagement and fast-forward them into
          a donation chair as soon as possible.

        <p class="brief">
          1) Breafing: Australian Red Cross Lifeblood was facing high rates of
          cancelled appointments, thousands of donors were cancelling their
          donations every week and 43% of first time donors were not coming
          back.
        </p>

          'How might we ensure that convenience is at the forefront in the
          scheduling process?'
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="challenges">
        2) Challenges: Analyse user behaviour and motivation; Align user needs,
        business goals and time constraints. Understand client and its market
        placement.
      </div>
      <div class="dealing-with-challenges">
        3) How to tackle those challenges? Primary & secondary research. Having
        deeper conversations with users. Finding issues and pain points within
        the current app. Ensuring the team is aligned with the ideas and
        solutions.
